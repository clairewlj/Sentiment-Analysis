Also, further segmentation (for example, by team as above) can be conducted to see if any specific team account for the difference, or it is a general difference across all teams at the same location. Then if we can target specific teams, for those having significantly high or low level of engagement and score, we can try to find the reason and see if other teams can learn from them."
